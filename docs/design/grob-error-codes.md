# Grob — Error Code Registry

> The authoritative registry for every error code emitted by the Grob compiler
> and runtime. This file is the source of truth; the website
> (`grob-lang.dev/errors`) is generated from it.
>
> **Stability:** see ADR-0017. Codes marked `pre-release` are subject to
> change until v1.0 ships; codes marked `stable` are immutable.
>
> _Created April 2026 — initial allocation, error-code numbering scheme session._
> _Authority: ADR-0014 (numbering scheme) and ADR-0017 (stability rule)._

## Format

Every code is an entry of the form `Exxxx`. The thousands digit encodes the
category; see ADR-0014 §Categories. Each entry in this registry has:

- `code` — the `Exxxx` identifier
- `title` — short title rendered after `error[Exxxx]:`
- `category` — one of: type / name resolution / syntax / module / param /
  runtime / internal
- `introduced` — Grob version in which the code first appeared
- `status` — `pre-release` / `stable` / `deprecated` / `retired`
- `description` — one-sentence description of the failure mode
- `throws_type` (runtime codes only) — the `GrobError` leaf this code
  corresponds to
- `superseded_by` (deprecated/retired only) — replacement code

Long-form documentation (cause / example / fix) lives in `docs/errors/Exxxx.md`,
read by `grob --explain Exxxx`.

---

### E0008 — named argument before positional

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A named argument appeared before a positional argument at a call site. The calling convention requires all positional arguments first, then named arguments.
- **Source decision:** D-318 (D-113).

---

### E0009 — named argument names a required parameter

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A named argument named a required (defaultless) parameter. Only parameters with a default value may be passed by name; required parameters are positional-only.
- **Source decision:** D-318 (D-113).

- **Description:** A `const` binding cannot be reassigned. Use `readonly` for runtime-once bindings or `:=` for mutable bindings.
- **Source decision:** D-288; D-292.

---

### E0202 — reassignment of `readonly` binding

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `readonly` binding cannot be reassigned after its initialiser has run. Use `:=` for mutable bindings.
- **Source decision:** D-288; D-291.

---

### E0203 — reassignment of `param` binding

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `param` binding is implicitly `readonly` and cannot be reassigned. Copy to a local variable to mutate.
- **Source decision:** D-291 (param implicitly readonly).

---

### E0204 — mutation of `readonly` value

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `readonly` value cannot be mutated. This includes mutating fields of a `readonly` struct or appending to a `readonly` array.
- **Source decision:** D-291 (deep immutability).

---

### E0205 — non-constant expression in `const` right-hand side

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** The right-hand side of a `const` declaration must be a compile-time constant expression (D-289). Allowed forms are: literals, grouped literals, binary arithmetic/comparison/logical operators on constant operands, unary `-`/`!` on constant operands, and references to other `const`-bound identifiers. References to `readonly` or mutable identifiers, function calls, array/map literals, and interpolated strings with `${}` are not allowed. Change the binding to `readonly` if a runtime value is needed.
- **Source decision:** D-288; D-289.

---

### E0301 — type cycle with no terminating field

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A type declaration contains a cycle of required non-nullable fields that would produce an infinitely-sized value. Break the cycle with a nullable field, an array, or a map.
- **Source decision:** D-287. Replaces the placeholder `E—cycle`.

---

### E0302 — recursive type without indirection

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A type's required field references the type itself directly. Sibling of E0301 — fires on the trivial single-type self-reference case where E0301's multi-step cycle walk is not needed.
- **Source decision:** D-287.

---

### E0303 — circular type dependency among top-level value bindings

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Two or more unannotated top-level value bindings (`readonly` or `var`) form a cycle in their initialisers such that the type of each binding cannot be resolved without first knowing the type of another in the cycle. Annotated bindings are resolved from their declared type and do not participate in value-type dependency edges; annotated mutual cycles surface instead as runtime E5902.
- **Source decision:** D-323.

---

### E0401 — generic type argument count mismatch

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A generic call site supplied a number of type arguments inconsistent with the generic's declaration.
- **Source decision:** D-286 (generic type argument forward references); OQ-001.

---

### E0402 — generic constraint violation

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A generic type argument does not satisfy the constraint declared on the type parameter, e.g. `sort<U: Comparable>` called with a non-comparable `U`.
- **Source decision:** D-281.

---

### E0501 — `for...in` subject is not iterable

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** The subject of a `for...in` loop is not an array, a map or a numeric range. Only those three forms can be iterated.
- **Source decision:** Sprint 4 Increment C.

---

### E0502 — single-identifier `for...in` over a `map`

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `for...in` loop over a `map` must bind two identifiers (`for k, v in m`). Iterate the keys alone with `for k in m.keys`.
- **Source decision:** Sprint 4 Increment C.

---

### E0503 — descending range without explicit negative `step`

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A numeric range whose start bound is greater than its end bound descends, and a descending range requires an explicit negative `step`. Add `step -1` (or another negative step) to iterate downward.
- **Source decision:** Sprint 4 Increment C.

---

### E0504 — reassignment of `for...in` iterator variable

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** The iteration variable of a `for...in` loop (`item`, the index `i`, or the map `k`/`v`) is immutable within the loop body and cannot be reassigned. Copy it to a `:=` binding to mutate a local.
- **Source decision:** Sprint 4 Increment C.

---

### E0505 — non-exhaustive switch expression

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A switch expression must cover every possible value of its scrutinee (§3.1). Coverage is proven by a `_` catch-all arm, by matching both `true` and `false` for a `bool` scrutinee, or by matching `nil` and otherwise covering the element type for a nullable scrutinee. Relational patterns never contribute to exhaustiveness. Add a `_` arm or cover the remaining cases. This is the deliberate counterpart to the non-exhaustive `select` statement (D-301).
- **Source decision:** Sprint 4 Increment E.

---

### E1001 — undefined identifier

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A bare identifier was referenced and is not declared in any enclosing scope.

---

### E1002 — undefined member

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A member access (`obj.field`) referenced a field or method not declared on the value's type.

---

### E1003 — undefined module

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A module-qualified call (`module.fn`) referenced a function not declared on the imported module.

---

### E1101 — shadowed declaration

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release (severity: warning)
- **Description:** A local declaration shadows a name from an enclosing scope. Emitted as a warning per D-024; reserved as `Exxxx` because the diagnostic-emission machinery is shared with errors and a future `--strict` mode may promote it.
- **Source decision:** D-024. Flagged for the warnings allocation pass.

---

### E1102 — variable already declared in this scope

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `:=` declaration was applied to a name that already exists in the current scope. Use `=` to reassign an existing binding.
- **Source decision:** Sprint 3 Increment A.

---

### E1103 — reserved identifier used as a binding name

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A reserved identifier was used as a binding name — a field, parameter, local or function. Reserved identifiers lex as ordinary identifiers and stay legal as member names after a `.`, but they may not be bound by user code. The v1 reserved identifiers are `formatAs` (D-282) and `select` (D-320). Rename the binding. This is what lets the `select` statement and the `arr.select(fn)` pipeline transform (D-280) share the name, and what lets `formatAs` be a module accessor without occupying the binding namespace.
- **Source decision:** D-320 (rule generalised from D-282; the `formatAs` reserved-identifier rule shipped without a code and is now covered here).

---

### E1201 — forward reference inside function body

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Inside a function body, a local variable was referenced before its declaration in the same scope. Forward references are permitted at the top level (D-286) but not within function bodies.
- **Source decision:** D-166; D-286.

---

### E1202 — use before declaration in block scope

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Inside a nested block, a local variable was referenced before its declaration in that block. Sibling of E1201 with tighter scope context.

---

### E2004 — unterminated raw string

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A backtick-delimited raw string was opened and never closed before end of file.
- **Source decision:** D-285.

---

### E2005 — invalid escape sequence

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A backslash escape sequence in a double-quoted string is not one of the defined forms. Unknown escapes are a compile error, not a permissive pass-through.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §8.

---

### E2006 — invalid numeric literal

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

---

### E2011 — stray semicolon

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Semicolons are not used in Grob — newlines terminate statements.

---

### E2012 — `#` not followed by `{`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A lone `#` is not a Grob token. `#{ }` opens an anonymous-struct literal.

---

### E2013 — single-character operator requires doubling

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A bare `&` or `|` is not a Grob operator; use `&&` or `||`.

---

### E2014 — unbalanced closing bracket

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `)`, `]`, or `}` was encountered with no matching opener.

---

### E2101 — bare `{` cannot begin an expression

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A bare `{` always begins a block. Use `#{ }` for an anonymous struct literal or `TypeName { }` for a named type construction.
- **Source decision:** D-043.

---

### E2102 — empty type construction missing `{ }`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A named type construction was written without the required `{ }` body, even when the type has only defaultable fields.

---

### E2201 — `import` after declaration

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `import` statements must precede all other declarations and code.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §19.

---

### E2202 — `param` after `fn` or top-level statement

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `param` blocks must precede `type` declarations, function declarations, and top-level code.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §19.

---

### E2203 — top-level `return`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `return` is not valid at script level. Use `exit(<n>)` to terminate a script with a status code.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §22.

---

### E2204 — `try` without `catch` or `finally`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `try` block must be followed by at least one `catch` clause or a `finally` block.
- **Source decision:** D-274; D-275.

---

### E2205 — `catch` after catch-all

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A bare `catch e` (catch-all) must be the last catch clause. Any catch after the catch-all is unreachable.
- **Source decision:** D-274.

---

### E2206 — `finally` not last in `try`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `finally`, when present, must appear after all `catch` clauses and may appear at most once.
- **Source decision:** D-275.

---

### E2207 — `return` / `break` / `continue` inside `finally`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Control-flow exits are not permitted inside a `finally` block. This is a deliberate divergence from C# — the "finally overrides return" behaviour has no legitimate use case.
- **Source decision:** D-275.

---

### E2208 — duplicate field name in type declaration

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `type` declaration listed the same field name more than once.

---

### E2209 — trailing comma not permitted here

- **Category:** Syntax

---

### E2210 — line continuation rule violation

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A statement spans multiple lines in a way the implicit line-continuation heuristic cannot resolve. Add explicit grouping or restructure.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §14.

---

### E2211 — `break` inside `select`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `break` does not apply inside a `select` arm. `select` has no fall-through (D-301), so there is nothing for `break` to exit, and `break` is not retargeted at an enclosing loop. Fires at any nesting, whether or not a loop encloses the `select`. To exit an enclosing loop from inside a `select`, restructure into a function and use `return`, or use a flag variable. `continue` inside a `select` is permitted and applies to the nearest enclosing loop.
- **Source decision:** D-315.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §3.

---

### E2212 — `break` / `continue` outside a loop

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `break` and `continue` are only valid inside a loop body (`while`, `for...in`). Neither appears inside any enclosing loop at the point of use. A `continue` inside a `select` resolves to the nearest enclosing loop and only raises this error when no loop encloses the `select`; a `break` inside a `select` raises E2211 instead.
- **Source decision:** D-315.
- **Source:** `grob-v1-requirements.md` §4.

---

### E3001 — unknown plugin

- **Category:** Module
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

- **Category:** Module
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** An `import X as <alias>` uses an alias that is reserved, conflicts with a keyword, or is otherwise not a valid identifier.

---

### E3101 — ambiguous unqualified type reference

- **Category:** Module
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Two imported plugins each register a type with the same unqualified name. Add `as <alias>` to one of the imports to disambiguate.
- **Source:** Session D Part 1, §D3 plugin type registration.

---

### E3102 — plugin type collides with stdlib type

- **Category:** Module
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A plugin registers a type whose unqualified name shadows a stdlib type. Add `as <alias>` to the plugin import.

### E4001 — unknown decorator

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A decorator was applied that is not one of the recognised decorators (`@secure`, `@allowed`, `@minLength`, `@maxLength`).

---

### E4002 — decorator not permitted here

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A decorator was applied to a target where it is not valid, e.g. `@secure` on a non-string param or a validation decorator outside a `param` block.
- **Source decision:** D-072.

---

### E4101 — invalid `@allowed` argument

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `@allowed(...)` received an argument list that is not a homogeneous set of literals matching the param's type. This is a grammar-level rejection at compile time, distinct from runtime validation failures (which fall under the runtime category if v1 scope-cut is not activated).
- **Source decision:** D-186 (validation decorators are a v1 scope-cut candidate; the grammar code is allocated regardless).

---

### E4102 — invalid `@minLength` / `@maxLength` argument

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `@minLength(n)` or `@maxLength(n)` received an argument that is not a non-negative integer literal, or was applied to a param whose type does not support length constraints.

---

### E4201 — `param` block syntax error

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `param` block contains a malformed parameter declaration — missing type annotation on a defaultless param, missing `:=` before a default, etc.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §19.

---

### E4202 — `param` after `param` block ends

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `param` declaration appeared after the `param` block has been closed by a non-`param` statement.

---

### E5001 — integer overflow

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

---

### E5006 — math domain violation

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Throws:** `ArithmeticError`
- **Description:** `math.sqrt(negative)`, `math.log(0)`, `math.log(negative)` and similar domain violations throw rather than silently producing `NaN`.
- **Source decision:** D-284; Session D Part 1 stdlib gap-fill.

---

### E5101 — array index out of range

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Throws:** `IndexError`

**Total: 109 codes across 7 categories.** This is the canonical current count;
it is the live total in the summary index above and is asserted equal to
`ErrorCatalog.All.Count` by the consistency drift gate (`Grob.Consistency.Tests`,
D-316). The dated lines below are the historical record of how the count
changed; this line is the single source for the present total.

_Initial allocation: 94 codes across 7 categories. All `pre-release` until v1.0 ships. Authority: ADR-0014 (numbering scheme) and ADR-0017 (stability rule)._

_Updated May 2026 — count corrected from a stale "86 codes" to the actual 94 codes present in the summary index and full entries. No codes were added in this edit; the footer total had not been updated as codes accrued. The 7-category structure (E0xxx–E9xxx) is unchanged._

_Updated June 2026 — Sprint 4 Increment C added the `for...in` iteration diagnostics E0501–E0504 in the previously empty E05xx sub-block of the Type category, bringing the total to 98 codes._

_Updated June 2026 — Sprint 4 Increment E added E0505 (non-exhaustive switch expression) to the E05xx sub-block of the Type category, bringing the total to 99 codes._

_Updated June 2026 — D-315: E2211 retitled to `break` inside `select` and E2212 retitled to `break` / `continue` outside a loop, reflecting the asymmetric resolution. Both codes pre-existed; no new codes were added by this edit._

_Updated June 2026 (interlude A, D-316) — canonical total corrected from a stale "99 codes" to the actual 103 present in the summary index and `ErrorCatalog`. Four codes had accrued without a footer count update: E0205 (Sprint 3), E1102 (Sprint 3), E2211 and E2212 (Sprint 4, D-315). No codes were added, removed or renumbered by this edit; the drift was in the prose total alone. A standing total line has been added above and the count is now gated by `Grob.Consistency.Tests` so this class of drift cannot recur silently._

_Updated June 2026 — Sprint 5 Increment B added the four named-argument call-site diagnostics E0008–E0011 (named-before-positional, naming a required parameter, duplicate named argument, unknown parameter name) in the E00xx sub-block of the Type category, bringing the total to 107 codes. Source decision D-318 (D-113)._

_Updated June 2026 — Sprint 5 correctness increment added E1103 (reserved identifier used as a binding name) in the E11xx sub-block of the Name resolution category, bringing the total to 108 codes. The code covers both `select` (D-320) and `formatAs` (D-282) — D-282's reserved-identifier rule had shipped with no code. Source decision D-320._
